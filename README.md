### 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m Josh, a Senior Software Engineer, based in London. I’ve been at RVU for over 2 years, working in [Uswitch Broadband](https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/), and now [Money.co.uk](https://www.money.co.uk). Before RVU, I worked mainly in consulting, building new products and prototypes for clients across a variety of industries.

I’m a dad to two energetic boys, so to keep my fitness up, I love gymming, cycling, plus my weekly Parkrun.

### 💌 My Availability and Comms Preferences

Being a busy ‘Dadveloper’, my timings are quite tight. On office days (Wednesday / Thursday), I’m normally in a mad rush to get my kids to school on time, followed by my commute, then I need to leave early at 4ish to pick them up. I’m most creative in the mornings, so focus time tends to be around then.

If you need me, Slack is fine, if you really need me then come and speak to me or give me a ring. I tend to be quite direct in my written communication, so please don’t take this as me being short or impatient with you I am keen to help, but also trying to get to the point to save time.

### 😁 What Makes Me Happy?

* Be direct and explicit with me, I don’t always work well with nuance and subtlety. If I know exactly what I need to do and I have no blockers, I will get things done, very quickly
* Keeping me as involved as possible, I love to give opinions and ideas, and hope that sometimes I give some insight that isn’t thought of before
* Solving problems together, I get a real kick out of solving problems with others, and tend to be intense and focussed in achieving this

### 😡 What Makes Me Grumpy?

* Context switching uses a lot of my energy. So please help me out by providing context for me
* Having to attend meetings that might be better off as an email / Slack, or that I probably won’t add much value to. RVU tends to be pretty good at meetings though

### 💪 My Strengths

* I’m full of ideas and get quite passionate about solving problems
* Perseverance, I strive to overcome obstacles
* I can be very astute, getting the best outcome from every situation
* I have a high self-awareness, and constantly trying to improve

### 🌱 My Opportunities for Growth

* Working on my communication style to be a bit less direct and more structured, at the correct amount of detail for the conversation
* Very keen to start leading, and getting the most out of the people that I lead

### 🙃 Extra Quirks

* Sometimes in conversations, I might interrupt or try to complete your sentences. I’m not doing this to be rude, I’m normally just very engaged and energetic. If it gets a bit too much, just ask me to let you finish
* I’ll also sometimes weigh in on conversations I’m overhearing if I feel I have something to add
* I have a lot of energy, so you might see my fidgeting or getting distracted by things that come in
* I might also be in a hyper-focus state on some work I’m doing, as a result, I might ignore any asynchronous communication (Slack, Emails). If you need me for something urgent feel free to grab me, otherwise I will get back to you. You may need to explain the context to me

### 📣 Feedback

* I thrive on useful, timely feedback. Don’t be afraid to give me constructive feedback after the moment, either verbally or written via Slack. I tend to assume things are ok unless told otherwise, and don’t deal too well with end of year surprises
* I tend to overthink and self reflect a lot, so keen to see how I act in situations from other people’s perspectives. Examples are great, the impact, and the alternative impact had I behaved differently
* I’m also happy to return the feedback favour if you’re comfortable
